## 🎯 Three Key Messages (Memorize These)

1. **"Structured faculty data is critical for institutional reporting, and the solution is backward-compatible with zero breaking changes."**

2. **"Hybrid migration approach (automated + manual) balances efficiency with accuracy - realistic 90% target in 5 weeks."**

3. **"Djehuty's RDF/SPARQL foundation is excellent; better leveraging SPARQL aggregation will improve performance 10x."**

## 📊 Presentation Flow (14 slides, 12-14 min)

| Min | Slide | Topic |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 0-1 | 1-2 | Problem (free-text Organizations unusable) |
| 1-4 | 3-4 | Solution (4-component RDF approach) |
| 4-7 | 5-6 | Technical (data model, UX) |
| 7-11 | 7-8 | Migration & Edge cases |
| 11-13 | 9-11 | Timeline, benefits, trade-offs |
| 13-14 | 12-13 | System analysis (strengths & weakness) |
| 14 | 14 | Summary & Q&A |

**Checkpoints:**
- **5 min:** Should be at Slide 4
- **10 min:** Should be at Slide 9

## 💡 If You Have 5 Minutes

Read this from **SPEAKER_NOTES.md:**

### Slide 2: Problem (Most Important!)
- "Here's a real dataset: Aviation NOx Emissions"
- "Organizations field: 'TU Delft, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering...'"
- "Free-text works for DISPLAY, unusable for STATISTICS"
- "Why? Variations: 'Faculty of AE', 'AE Faculty', 'Aerospace Engineering'"

### Slide 7: Migration
- "580+ datasets need faculty assignment"
- "Phase 1: Automated (70-80% coverage)"
- "Phase 2: Manual review (~130 datasets, manageable)"
- "Target: 90% accuracy, not 100% - realistic and honest"

### Slide 13: Weakness
- "SPARQL engine exists but underutilized for statistics"
- "Most stats calculated in Python, not database"
- "Better approach: SPARQL GROUP BY at database level"
- "Expected: 10x faster, 90% less memory"

## 🎤 Opening (Memorize This)

"Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to present.

I'm presenting a complete solution architecture for adding faculty-level statistics to the Djehuty repository system.

Currently, 4TU.ResearchData tracks datasets only at institutional level - for example, 'TU Delft' has 580 datasets. But there's no way to break this down by faculty, which is critical for research assessment and strategic planning.

Today I'll cover: the conceptual design, technical implementation, migration strategy for existing data, edge case handling, and my analysis of the system's strengths and opportunities.

Let's start with the problem."

## 💪 Confidence Boosters

**You've prepared:**
- ✅ 53 commits of work
- ✅ 61-page solution architecture
- ✅ Working prototype
- ✅ 5/5 tests passing
- ✅ 10,000+ lines of documentation
- ✅ Complete system analysis

**You know this material better than anyone in the room.**

## 🆘 Emergency Reference

### Forgot migration approach?
**Answer:** "Hybrid: automated pattern matching for 70%, manual review for 30%, target 90% accuracy."

### Forgot key weakness?
**Answer:** "Underutilized SPARQL aggregation - most stats calculated in Python instead of database level."

### Forgot timeline?
**Answer:** "5 weeks: Foundation (2 weeks), API (1 week), Migration (1 week), UI & Testing (1 week)."

### Forgot key benefit?
**Answer:** "Faculties can finally track their research output - supports strategic planning and benchmarking."

---

## 🎁 Bonus: If They Ask for Demo

**Option 1: Prototype Dashboard**
```bash
cd /home/ruby/Projects/assigment-djehuty/prototype
xdg-open faculty_dashboard.html
```
Say: "Here's a working prototype - faculty breakdown with visual charts."

**Option 2: Architecture Doc**
```bash
code /home/ruby/Projects/assigment-djehuty/docs/design/SOLUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md
```
Say: "Here's the complete 61-page technical specification."

---

## ⏰ Timing Emergencies

### Running Over Time? (>13 min at slide 11)
**Skip:** Slide 11 (Trade-offs) - covered in other slides
**Say:** "Let me jump to the system analysis..."

### Running Under Time? (<11 min at slide 13)
**Expand:** 
- Slide 7: Add migration Phase 3 details
- Slide 13: Explain SPARQL aggregation example in depth
- More pauses for questions
