# Faculty Statistics Dashboard - Demo Documentation

## Overview
This dashboard demonstrates the faculty-level statistics visualization for the 4TU.ResearchData prototype.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Demo Data Notice

**The dashboard displays MOCK/SAMPLE DATA for demonstration purposes.**

### Why Mock Data?

1. **Phase 1 Complete**: RDF model and backend methods are fully functional
2. **Phase 2A Complete**: Migration analysis proved faculty extraction works (44% coverage, 100% accuracy)
3. **Phase 2B Limitation**: Migration execution was blocked by Virtuoso write permissions
4. **Phase 3**: Dashboard shows the structure and what it would look like after migration

### Current Data Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Faculty RDF Entities | ✅ Real | 3 faculties in triple store |
| Backend Methods | ✅ Real | `faculty_statistics()` works |
| Dataset Counts | ⚠️ Mock | Using sample data for demo |
| Visualizations | ✅ Real | Live Chart.js rendering |

### Mock Data Values

**Institutions (9 total datasets distributed):**
- TU Delft: 3 datasets
- University of Twente: 1 dataset
- TU Eindhoven: 1 dataset
- Utrecht University: 4 datasets

**Faculties (TU Delft breakdown, 9 datasets):**
- EEMCS (Faculty of EEMCS): 4 datasets
- AE (Aerospace Engineering): 3 datasets
- AS (Applied Sciences): 2 datasets

**Note**: The 9 datasets shown match the actual number of datasets in the Virtuoso triple store. After migration (Phase 2B completion), these would reflect real faculty assignments.

## How to View

1. **Start HTTP Server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd prototype
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open Dashboard**:
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/faculty_dashboard.html`
   - The dashboard fetches data from `dashboard_data.json`

3. **Regenerate Data** (optional):
   ```bash
   source djehuty-env/bin/activate
   python3 prototype/generate_dashboard_data.py
   ```

## Dashboard Features

### 5 Visualizations

1. **Institution-Level Bar Chart** (EXISTING)
   - Shows current system: 4 institutions
   - Mock data distributed across institutions

2. **Top Faculties Bar Chart** (NEW)
   - Shows new feature: faculty-level breakdown
   - Mock data for 3 TU Delft faculties

3. **Faculty Distribution Pie Chart** (NEW)
   - Visual distribution of datasets across faculties
   - Mock data showing relative contributions

4. **Hierarchy Chart** (NEW)
   - TU Delft breakdown: Institution → Faculties
   - Demonstrates the hierarchical extension pattern

5. **Granularity Comparison** (NEW)
   - Before vs After visual explanation
   - Shows 11.75x granularity increase potential

### Overview Statistics

- **Total Datasets**: 9 (matches real triple store)
- **Total Institutions**: 4
- **Total Faculties**: 3 (sample; full system would be ~47)
- **Granularity Gain**: 11.75x (47 faculties / 4 institutions)

## Interview Talking Points

### What to Say:
✅ "This dashboard demonstrates the visualization layer of the faculty statistics feature."
✅ "I'm using mock data because the migration process requires write permissions to the triple store."
✅ "The structure, backend, and visualization are all working - only the data population is pending migration."
✅ "These numbers are realistic - based on the 9 actual datasets in the system and migration analysis showing 44% coverage."

### What NOT to Say:
❌ "This is real data from migrated datasets"
❌ "The migration is complete"

### If Asked: "Why mock data?"
💡 "Phase 2 migration was limited by Virtuoso write permissions in the demo environment. The migration logic is complete and demonstrated in `migrate_sample_faculty.py`, but I couldn't execute the actual writes. For this prototype, I'm showing what the dashboard would look like after migration runs in production."

## Production Deployment

In production, the dashboard would:

1. ✅ Fetch real data from `faculty_statistics()` and `institution_statistics()`
2. ✅ Reflect actual dataset counts after migration
3. ✅ Update dynamically as new datasets are added
4. ✅ Support filtering, drill-down, and interactive features

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript
- **Charts**: Chart.js 4.4.0 (CDN)
- **Data**: JSON file generated by Python backend
- **Backend**: Djehuty SPARQL Interface
- **No build process**: Runs directly in browser
