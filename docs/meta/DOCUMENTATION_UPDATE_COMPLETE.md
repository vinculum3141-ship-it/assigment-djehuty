## What's Remaining (Optional 10%)

### SOLUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md (61 pages)

**Status:** Can be used as-is with note, or updated incrementally

**Why Optional:**
- Very large document (61 pages, ~3000 lines)
- Faculty sections remain 100% valid (genuinely new work)
- Institution sections can be referenced with note
- Users now have updated entry points (README, Executive Summary, Architecture Summary)

**If You Want to Update:**

**Quick Approach (15 minutes):**
- Add discovery notice at top
- Add section referencing archived v1
- Add note about institution sections

**Thorough Approach (2 hours):**
- Add comprehensive discovery section
- Update all institution sections to reference existing infrastructure
- Preserve all faculty sections (still valid)
- Add architecture decision rationale
- Add appendix with archived reference

**Recommendation:** Quick approach is sufficient. The detailed architecture is well-documented and faculty sections (the actual new work) are completely valid.
